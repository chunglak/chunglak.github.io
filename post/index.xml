One of my proudest moment as a father was when, a few years back, I had to rack my brains to find the words to explain to my eldest son, who was probably around seven at the time, what was a black man. We were living in Singapore at the time, so the people around us were very diverse ethnically; still, he truly didn&amp;#39;t understand what was meant by putting a person in a box named &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sun Tzu said: know yourself, know your opponent, and not a single battle you will lose; know yourself, don&amp;#39;t know your opponent, lose one, win one; know neither yourself nor your opponent, every battle you will lose. I can&amp;#39;t help but feeling the full force of this quote as I, along with the rest of the world, watch incredulously as America flails helplessly while China is coasting along with an assurance not seen since &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macartney_Embassy&#34;&gt;British ambassador Macartney met with the Qianlong Emperor in 1793&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
