One of my proudest moment as a father was when, a few years back, I had to rack my brains to find the words to explain to my eldest son, who was probably around seven at the time, what was a black man. We were living in Singapore at the time, so the people around us were very diverse ethnically; still, he truly didn&#39;t understand what was meant by putting a person in a box named &#34;black&#34;.</p>
<p>
We didn&#39;t do anything special, I guess it&#39;s just that we never defined a person to him by his &#34;race&#34;.</p>
<p>
Me, of course, as a Chinese immigrant to France, I got used to be on the receiving end of racism since I was a child. This was a time (late 70s, 80s) when racism was casual: one in a while, often in a off-handed manner, you&#39;d be made to notice you&#39;re different from the majority, be questioned about where-you&#39;re-from. This being France, where races officially don&#39;t exist and distinctions based on them are forbidden, integration is more a question of fitting in the culture, speaking good French, having the same habits as the locals, etc.
The deal was (and still is), the Republic accepts you as you are as long as you&#39;re willing to fit in and accept the values of the Republic. Good deal, right?</p>
<p>
Like everybody, I followed the BLM events in the US and a bit around the world, and what troubled me was how much the black militants (and their allies) and the white supremacists are acting from the same playbook. They both agree that humans are divided in races and they each vie for supremacy in a zero-sum game for the society.  
Being anti-racist in America looks very much like being racist, just you swap the characters. Negative, or regular, discrimination is swapped for positive discrimination. Instead of oppressing the Blacks, you elevate them above the others of the same merit who are not black.
In America, race is a all-encompassing issue, from movies to the presidential election, you can&#39;t escape it. It has to be taken into account for everything. Saying things like Stephen King said, that he would never consider &#34;diversity&#34; when judging art, is anathema. Kamala Harris&#39; main qualification to be Joe Biden&#39;s running mate is, aside from being a woman, to be black. Let&#39;s remember how she was eviscerated in the debates with the other primary candidates and how abysmally low she polled.</p>
<p>
Of course, all this is mainly for show. Just like having a female Prime Minister in Pakistan didn&#39;t lessen the number of &#34;honor killings&#34;, having Blacks everywhere in prominent political roles did not change the balance of power one inch in the USA. And prosternating in front of BLM to the point of <a href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=48302">censuring a word in Chinese that sounds like the N-word</a> is not going to make black people more respected. One can even argue that, precisely because they feel empowered by the newfound reverence showed by everybody from mega-corporations to the most powerful politicians, black people will accept more willingly their place in the society without any change needed.</p>
<p>
And when you think about how Americans define race, it&#39;s basically: if any of your ancestors are black, then you&#39;re black, as if it were a stain that contaminates all the descendants. Why not: if any of your ancestors is white, then you&#39;re white? This alone marks the fundamental assymetry between white and others. If one accepts this premise, then the superiority of white people is just built-in your thought system, there&#39;s just no way out of this, and BLM is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>
So that&#39;s why I decided to renounce the concept of race (and racism) totally. The current framework within which people think about racism is fundamentally a white supremacist construct. Fighting racism is saying in effect: oh, the white people are so strong and wicked, they take everything for themselves; please, misters, give us something!</p>
<p>
While Western countries dominated the global discourse, it seemed there was no alternative to this current of thought. After all, it did look as if the white people were superior. But the sudden resurgence of China, after centuries of slumber, especially vivid during the Covid crisis, has given me pause. Here&#39;s a country that for millenia was the most powerful in the world roaring back to its rightful place and 20% of the world population who don&#39;t think white people are superior. They don&#39;t need to stage protest or hold CLM placards; they just go about their life, not needing white people&#39;s approval.</p>
<p>
Somehow racism is one of the more successful cultural exports of the West, making the rest of the world believe in the superiority of white people. One just needs to see the discreet deference shown by most Japanese when approached by a white person in the street in Japan. They just can&#39;t help it. It always saddens me that such a proud and refined people have this kind of reaction.</p>
<p>
But help is on the way! As the power and influence of the West recede in relative terms, people around the world will progressively become like my son when he was young, oblivious of physical features formerly known as &#34;races&#34;. As for me it&#39;s too late for that to happen naturally, so I force myself to live true to the ideals of the French Republic and ignore willfully the boxes my unconscious mind tries to put people in.</p>
