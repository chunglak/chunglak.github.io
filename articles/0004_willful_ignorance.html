Sun Tzu said: know yourself, know your opponent, and not a single battle you will lose; know yourself, don't know your opponent, lose one, win one; know neither yourself nor your opponent, every battle you will lose. I can't help but feeling the full force of this quote as I, along with the rest of the world, watch incredulously as America flails helplessly while China is coasting along with an assurance not seen since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macartney_Embassy">Macartney met with the Qianlong Emperor in 1793</a>.<br>
</p>

</div>
<p>
<br>
In 1793, the roles were reversed: the Chinese were so confident in their own supremacy that they didn't show the slightest interest or even curiosity in anything the Europeans were showing them, just calling them dismissively "barbarians". In the meantime the English were trying to learn all they could about China and her secrets, filling volumes with their observations. When conflict broke out in later years, arrogant China was a sitting duck for the enterprising and knowledgeable Europeans.<br>
</p>

<p>
In America, there's hardly a press article about China that doesn't contain the word "communist" which of course is the word that activates a Pavlovian reflex of recoil even among the most liberal of Americans. Branding China as communist is like the ancient Chinese branding the Europeans as barbarians, it magically dispels all doubts and thinking. No need to learn from them! We're right and they're wrong!<br>
</p>

<p>
What is fascinating is that, objectively, the US has a free press, and most facts (and non-facts) are widely disseminated. Everyone has access to them, and could make up their own mind. But the reality is that there's just such a wide consensus on many crucials topics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialized_medicine">universal healthcare is tyranny</a>, the market should be the final arbiter in all things except when the corporate giants need a bailout, China is run by bad people out to get America, Russia is always trying to cause trouble, and of course, America is so exceptional that it doesn't need to play by the rules it imposes on others).<br>
</p>

<p>
Of course, China doesn't have a free press, all media must toe the official line. But everybody there knows that, so that provides some "immunity" against believing too naïvely what one sees on TV. You learn to read between the lines, even, God forbids, to think for yourself. In the West, under the cover of the free press, people tend to swallow whole what "respectable" media tells them as the Gospel.<br>
</p>

<p>
How this consensus has been built and is maintained is a very rich topic that has been studied extensively by the likes of Noam Chomsky. But for the moment, let's just recognize its existence and its pervasive influence in guiding US policy. Trump is hilarious when he spews his stream of consciousness live on TV, saying out loud just anything that goes through his head at that instant. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177">Injecting bleach is an idea to be studied</a>. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/5/21247823/trump-coronavirus-claims-was-right-americans-worried-polls">I saved America from the coronavirus</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOcY3XlzPzs">I'm not responsible</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3QXrQDTDYo">I have total authority</a>. And all the media around the world are reporting these divagations as if they contain any useful information.<br>
</p>

<p>
But there is a method to the madness, I have to admit. Repeating affirmations over and over, even baseless or easily rebuked, just works. Like a steamroller, it progressively grinds down any common sense objections that the free media can have. We've seen it in the past, like with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/07/usa.iraq1">George W. Bush and his weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003</a>. Now the playbook is back on. Even as the mainstream media points out the inaccuracy in the pronouncements of the government, it can't help but report them and drill down the talking points, however outrageous, into the minds of the public.<br>
</p>

<p>
So it's now common sense in the West in general, that China lied about the coronavirus and didn't warn the world, and that's why it has become a health catastrophe of epic proportions in America and Europe. But even a cursory glance at the timeline shows the absurdity of this notion. On January 23rd, Wuhan and its 11 million inhabitants were put under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_Hubei">strict lockdown</a>, followed shortly by the whole province of Hubei, with its 57 million people. Then China almost halted the economy of the whole country to fight the virus. If that's not a sufficient warning to the rest of the world, it's hard to see what could have been.<br>
</p>

<p>
Why did the West do nothing until mid-March? A kind way to look at it was to relate that to the experience of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_swine_flu_pandemic">swine flu H1N1 in 2009</a>, when the WHO declared a pandemic and in the end it wasn't a big deal. And that's an angle that the Western governments could have played, but that would have forced them to admit errors and strangely it seems more difficult for democracies to admit to errors than for "autocracies". China has freely admitted that there has been some confusion and errors made at the beginning of the epidemic, but then plunged into the battle wholeheartedly and seems to be winning (for the moment).<br>
</p>

<p>
Somehow people have forgotten about the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war">fog of war</a>. In a war, uncertainty is rife, unknowns abound, errors are inevitably made, but what counts are the results. But the Western governments are paralyzed by the fear of appearing to make mistakes, of being criticized, so they stuck to a middle road that has proved (and will continue to prove) catastrophic. Pandering to public opinions has never been a successful way to overcome a crisis.<br>
</p>

<p>
The only Western country that has acted with courage is Sweden, where the government decided lucidly not to enforce a lockdown to avoid tanking the economy. Sure, they are paying a heavy price in lives, but not worse that France, Spain or the US where the haphazard decisions have conspired to produce the worst of both worlds and will continue to hobble these countries. Let's put the death toll in perspective: in Sweden the current death toll is 0.03% of the population. It may sound callous to say, but they'll survive, I think. One of the worst is probably the UK, where they at first they were all stiff-upper-lipped about developing herd immunity by doing nothing, and then promptly caved in when the polls turned against them.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I think the fundamental reason the Western countries didn't do anything until it was too late is because they didn't take China seriously. When they locked down 60 million people, the only concern was about whether the lockdown "respected the human rights" of the people, like it was not a question of life and death. They probably thought the Chinese didn't know what they were doing, because they look at China through the veil of willful ignorance woven by the "free press".<br>
